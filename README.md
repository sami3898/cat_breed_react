## Description

The cat breed app is a React application that can identify cat breeds from images. The model used in the app is trained on 8 cat breeds, which include:

- Russian Blue
- Maine Coon
- Persian
- Bengal
- Ragdoll
- Sphynx
- Scottish Fold
- British Shorthair

The app uses TensorFlow's MobileNet to determine if there is a cat in the provided picture. If a cat is detected, a custom model, trained using Google's Teachable Machine, classifies the cat breed.

As a React Native developer, this is my first attempt at using React to create this small application.
